# |-------Analysis-------|

# 1.
# The binary search count is SIGNIFICANTLY faster than the built in list count.

# 2.
# The longer the list the greater the distance between the two count methods in time. For example
# a list of 1 million items would take much more time for the linear count to complete. However a
# list of just 5 items is quicker for the linear count to complete.

# 3.
# Changing the range of the random numbers in the list does not seem to affect the runtime greatly.
# Having a range of 100,000 gave a similar result to a range of just 1.

# 4.
# Having a range of 30,000 for the numbers that will be counted and a range of 1 for the numbers
# that will be added to the list, gives a similar output to any other combination of these ranges.
# Therefore changing the range of the random numbers has at most a very minimal affect on the
# runtime of both counts.

# 5.
# Yes, these results makes sense because runtime complexity is primarily affected by size of the
# list inputted (Commonly represented as N). Furthermore, changing the amount of times the program
# runs with the "desired_numbers" input will not have a significant affect on the complexity
# because the binary count is unaffected by the quantity of desired numbers and the linear count
# can be affected both positively and negatively in an equal capacity. Moreover, the only time
# that the linear count will outperform the binary count is if the list of numbers is very small.

# Linear count complexity = O(N)
# Binary count compexity = O(log N)
